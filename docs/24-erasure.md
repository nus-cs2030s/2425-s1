# Unit 24: Type Erasure

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"

    Students should

    - understand that generics are implemented with type erasure in Java.
    - understand that type information is not fully available during run-time when generics are used, and problems that this could cause.
    - be aware that arrays and generics don't mix well in Java.
    - know the terms reifiable type and heap pollution.

## Implementing Generics

There are several ways one could implement generics in a programming language.

### Code Specialization

For instance, in C#, every instantiation of a generic type causes new code to be generated for that instantiated type.  For instance, instantiating `Pair<S,T>` into `Pair<String,Integer>` causes a new type to be generated during run-time.  In C++ and in Rust, instantiating `Pair<String,Integer>` causes new code to be generated during compile-time.  This approach is sometimes called _code specialization_.

The disadvantages of such approach are

- codes are duplicated, so the resulting program is larger.
- changing the client by adding more use cases requires recompilation of the entire generic `Pair` class as we may need to generate the specialized code for a new type.

Note, in the example below, the specialized codes are __hypothethcal__ as Java does not use code specialization technique.  Additionally, the name of the class is improper as it contains the character `#`.

=== "Template Code"
    ```java
    class Pair<S, T> {
      private S first;
      pruvate T second;

      public Pair(S first, T second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
      }
    }
    ```
=== "String/Integer"
    ```java
    class Pair#String#Integer {
      private String first;
      pruvate Integer second;

      public Pair(String first, Integer second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
      }
    }
    ```
=== "Sender/Receiver"
    ```java
    class Pair#Sender#Receiver {
      private Sender first;
      pruvate Receiver second;

      public Pair(Sender first, Receiver second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
      }
    }
    ```


### Code Sharing

Java takes a _code sharing_ approach, instead of creating a new type for every instantiation, it chooses to _erase_ the type parameters and type arguments during compilation (_after type checking, of course_).  Thus, there is only one representation of the generic type in the generated code, representing all the instantiated generic types, regardless of the type arguments.  The resulting compiled code does not to be recompiled when encountering new types!  

Part of the reason to do this is for compatibility with the older version of Java.  Java introduces generics only from version 5 onwards.  Prior to version 5, one has to use `Object` to implement classes that are general enough to works on multiple types, similar to what we did with `Pair` here:

```Java title="Pair v0.1"
class Pair {
  private Object first;
  private Object second;

  public Pair(Object first, Object second) {
    this.first = first;
    this.second = second;
  }

  public Object getFirst() {
    return this.first;
  }

  public Object getSecond() {
    return this.second;
  }
}
```

The Java type erasure process transforms the code below into the code above.  Press on the tab to see the comparison.


=== "Generic Code"
    ```Java title="Pair v0.2"
    class Pair<S,T> {
      private S      first;
      private T      second;

      public Pair(S      first, T      second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
      }

      public S      getFirst() {
        return this.first;
      }

      public T      getSecond() {
        return this.second;
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Type Erased Code (_aligned_)"
    ```Java title="Pair v0.2 (Type Erased)"
    class Pair      {
      private Object first;
      private Object second;

      public Pair(Object first, Object second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
      }

      public Object getFirst() {
        return this.first;
      }

      public Object getSecond() {
        return this.second;
      }
    }
    ```

Note that each type parameter `S` and `T` are replaced with `Object`.  If the type parameter is bounded, it is replaced by the bounds instead (_e.g., If_ `T extends GetAreable`_, then_ `T` _is replaced with_ `GetAreable`).

Where a generic type is instantiated and used, the code

```Java
Integer i = new Pair<String,Integer>("hello", 4).getSecond();
```

is transformed into

```Java
Integer i = (Integer) new Pair("hello", 4).getSecond();
```

The generated code is similar to what we would write earlier, but this is generated by the compiler after type checking, it ensures that the casting will not lead to `ClassCastException` during run-time.

Type erasures have several important implications.  We will explore some of them below, and a few others during recitation.  

## Generics and Arrays Can't Mix

Let's consider the __hypothetical__ code below (_that does not compile_):


=== "Generic Code"
    ```Java
    // create a new array of pairs
    Pair<String,Integer>[] pairArray = new Pair<String,Integer>[2];

    // pass around the array of pairs as an array of object
    Object[] objArray = pairArray;

    // put a pair into the array -- no ArrayStoreException!
    objArray[0] = new Pair<Double,Boolean>(3.14, true);
    ```

=== "Type Erased Code (_aligned_)"
    ```Java
    // create a new array of pairs
    Pair                [] pairArray = new Pair                [2];

    // pass around the array of pairs as an array of object
    Object[] objArray = pairArray;

    // put a pair into the array -- no ArrayStoreException!
    objArray[0] = new Pair                (3.14, true);
    ```

This is similar to what we have in [Unit 21](21-variance.md), where we showed we could get an `ArrayStoreException` due to Java arrays being covariant.  We would not, however, get an exception when we try to put a pair of double and boolean, into an array meant to store a pair of string and integer!  This type checking is done during run-time, and due to type erasure, the run-time has no information about what is the type arguments to `Pair`.  The run-time sees:

=== "Type Erased Code"
    ```Java
    // create a new array of pairs
    Pair[] pairArray = new Pair[2];

    // pass around the array of pairs as an array of object
    Object[] objArray = pairArray;

    // put a pair into the array -- no ArrayStoreException!
    objArray[0] = new Pair(3.14, true);
    ```

It checks that we have an array of pairs and we are putting another pair inside.   Everything checks out.  This would have caused a _heap pollution_, a term that refers to the situation where a variable of a parameterized type refers to an object that is not of that parameterized type.

Heap pollution is dangerous, as now, we will get a `ClassCastException` when we do:
```Java
// getting back a string?  -- now we get ClassCastException
String str = pairArray[0].getFirst();
```

The example above shows why generics and arrays don't mix well together.  An array is what is called _reifiable_ type -- a type where full type information is available during run-time.  It is because Java array is reifiable that the Java run-time can check what we store into the array matches the type of the array and throw an `ArrayStoreException` at us if there is a mismatch.  Java generics, however, is not reifiable due to type erasure.  Java designers have decided not to mix the two.

The hypothetical code above actually is not a valid Java syntax.  We can't compile this line:
```Java
Pair<String,Integer>[] pairArray = new Pair<String,Integer>[2];
```

The following are illegal as well:
```Java
new Pair<S,T>[2];
new T[2];
```

On the other hand, given a generic type `T`, the following is allowed.

```Java
T[] array;
```

In summary, generic array _declaration_ is fine but generic array _instantiation_ is not.
